## Key Insights

### Dimensional Accuracy Variation
- Excellent Z-axis prediction (1.2cm error)
- Good Y-axis prediction (31.7cm error)
- Challenging X-axis prediction (2.98m error)

### Visualization Analysis
Three key visualizations were generated to analyze model performance:

1. test_set_visualization.png: 3D scatter plot comparing predicted vs ground truth positions
2. error_distributions.png: Error distribution histograms for each dimension
3. error_heatmap.png: 2D visualization of error magnitudes across space

### Challenges Faced
1. Significant variation in prediction accuracy across dimensions
2. X-axis predictions showing notably higher error
3. Need for careful regularization to prevent overfitting

## System Effectiveness
The system demonstrates:
- High reliability for vertical positioning (Z-axis)
- Moderate accuracy for one horizontal dimension (Y-axis)
- Limited accuracy for the other horizontal dimension (X-axis)

This suggests the system could be particularly effective for:
- Floor-level detection in multi-story buildings
- Relative positioning along the Y-axis
- Applications where Z-axis accuracy is critical

## Future Improvements
1. Investigate causes of X-axis prediction challenges
2. Consider additional feature engineering for X-axis prediction
3. Experiment with alternative model architectures
4. Collect additional training data in challenging prediction regions
