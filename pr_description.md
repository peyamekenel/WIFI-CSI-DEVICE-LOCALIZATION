# Improvements
- Convert CSI amplitude to spectrograms using STFT with pre-emphasis filtering
- Improve X-axis prediction accuracy (RMSE: 3.27m vs baseline 4.59m)
- Reduce overall mean Euclidean error (3.29m vs baseline 3.85m)
- Add comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations

## Technical Details
- Added pre-emphasis filtering for high-frequency components
- Increased FFT bins from 64 to 128 for better frequency resolution
- Modified hop length from 16 to 32 samples
- Implemented memory-efficient training configuration

## Results
- X-axis RMSE: 3.27m (28.7% improvement)
- Y-axis RMSE: 0.51m (slight regression from 0.48m)
- Z-axis RMSE: 0.05m (28.6% improvement)
- Mean Euclidean Error: 3.29m (14.6% improvement)
- Median Euclidean Error: 3.26m (1.5% improvement)
